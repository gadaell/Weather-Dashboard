# Purpose

A website that generates the weather of different cities. It will displays the Temperature, Wind, UV Index and Humidity.

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Challenges

- My biggest challenge was trying to figure out why my JavaScript code was not working. I had to get with my tutor and we troubleshoot the whole code from bottom to top. One of my variable was named "location" and that was the issue. After I changed the name to "destination", everything started to work.
